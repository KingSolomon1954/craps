${BRIGHT}NAME${CLEAR}
    C++ Static Analysis

${BRIGHT}DESCRIPTION${CLEAR}
    Static analysis can be performed against all source code
    in the repository or against a single individual file. 
    Underlying tool is 'cppcheck'. See cppcheck man page.

    See https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/manual.html

${BRIGHT}Static Analysis of Entire Repo:${CLEAR}
    > make analysis
    > open _build/static-analysis/report/index.html

${BRIGHT}Static Analysis of a Single File:${CLEAR}
    Invoke target with path and a suffix of '.sta'

    > make main/src/RoyalCraps.sta
    # Results are output as text to the console.
    # Be aware there is no output if file has no errors.

${BRIGHT}Suppressing Errors:${CLEAR}
    Static analysis may report errors that you feel should be
    ignored. If so, cppcheck allows suppression of these.

    The makefile looks a suppression-list file that is
    fed to cppcheck.
    
    \$\(D_TOOLS\)/static-analysis/suppression-list.txt

    See the cppcheck manual for suppression file format details, 
    An entry has this format:

    [error]:[file]:[line] // suppress error seen in this file at lineno
    [error]:[file]        // suppress error seen in this file at any lineno
    [error]               // suppress error seen in any file at any lineno

    Here is an example entry:

    leakReturnValNotUsed:/work/main/src/RoyalCraps.cpp:54

${BRIGHT}Repository Setup:${CLEAR}
    Instructions on how to incorporate in repo makefile

    1. Top level makefile includes submake
    include \$\(D_MAK\)/cpp-static-analysis.mak

    2. Top level makefile defines D_SRCS variable, where to find sources
    D_SRCS := main/include main/src lib-gen/include lib-gen/src ...
