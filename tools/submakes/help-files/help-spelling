${BRIGHT}NAME${CLEAR}
    Spell Checking
    
${BRIGHT}DESCRIPTION${CLEAR}
    Spell checking can be performed against a given file or a tree
    of files via Makefile target. Spelling can be run in interactive or
    batch mode.  Underlying tool is 'hunspell'. See hunspell man page
    for interactive mode handling.

    See https://linux.die.net/man/1/hunspell

${BRIGHT}* Spell check interactively against a single file:${CLEAR}

    > make <filepath>.ispell
    > make docs/src/index.ispell

    Meant to be run on your desktop. You are prompted on screen for
    corrections. The file will be changed in-place. Options include
    updating the private dictionary.

${BRIGHT}* Spell check all repo docs interactively:${CLEAR}

    > make spelling-it

    Meant to be run on your desktop. Runs against *.rst files found
    under docs/src folder. You are prompted on screen for corrections
    file by file. Each file will be changed in-place. On screen options
    include updating the private dictionary.

${BRIGHT}* Spell check a single file in batch mode:${CLEAR}

    > make <filepath>.bspell
    > make docs/src/index.bspell

    Meant to be run on your desktop. Creates a file that lists mispelled
    and unrecognized words. Find the file in folder _build/spelling.
    Source files and private dictionary are untouched.

${BRIGHT}* Spell check all docs in batch mode:${CLEAR}

    > make spelling

    Meant to be run on your desktop. Runs against *.rst files found
    under docs/src folder. Creates a file
    _build/spelling/spelling-results.txt that lists mispelled and
    unrecognized words. Source files and private dictionary are
    untouched.

${BRIGHT}FILES${CLEAR}
    Private dictionary. Input and output (if interactive).
    <repo>/docs/src/dictionary/dictionary.txt

    Batch mode site mispellings. Output file.
    _build/spelling/spelling-results.txt

    Batch mode single file mispellings. Output file.
    _build/spelling/<base-file-name>.bspell

${BRIGHT}ENVIRONMENT${CLEAR}
    Requires desktop Linux 'find' and 'cat' utility in path for repo
    level spelling.

    Optional desktop Linux 'sort' utility, if found in path, is used
    to sort the spelling results file.  Sorting is not necessary, but
    it elminates duplicates and easier to read.
