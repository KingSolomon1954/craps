Placeholder file.

Potentially overwritten later when `make docs` is issued.

When `make docs` is run, and it finds a populated `_build/debug/coverage`
folder, then its contents are copied into the docs tree overwriting this
file.

.. Placeholder file that allows sphinx indexes to resolve.
   Real index file is overwritten later.
